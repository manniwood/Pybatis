Dependencies:

1. Ensure Jinja2 is installed.

2. Ensure the Python DB API - compliant driver for your database
is installed. (Currently, Pybatis only supports psycopg for
PostgreSQL.)

Then, install Pybatis. You have two options:

1. Copy the ./pybatis directory to a directory that is already in
your Python path, or

2. Point your Python path to the directory holding this file,
so that the ./pybatis directory will be in the Python path (so
that 'import pybatis' will work).
